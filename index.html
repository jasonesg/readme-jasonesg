      <p>We have started with one goal and one focus: creating breakthrough technology that matters.</p>
      <p>Our mission is our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve our vision.</p>
      <p>We approach innovation and responsibility in tandem, as challenges to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our integrity always remains ahead.</p>
      <p>This way, we can scale in peace.</p>
      <p>Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means innovation, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.</p>
      <p>We are assembling a lean, exceptional team of the world's best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on our mission and nothing else.</p>
      <p>If that's you, we offer an opportunity to do your life's work and help solve the most important technical challenge of our age.</p>
      <p>It's ridiculously unreasonable that it might actually work out.</p>
